      <h2>Youth Highlighted During San Diego California Temple Dedication </h2>
      <h4>By Helen J. Read</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="news">
      <p>A focus on children and youth highlighted the twenty-three dedicatory sessions for the San Diego California
        Temple held April 25â€“30. The emphasis began with the April 25 cornerstone ceremony and continued throughout the
        activities, which were presided over by President Gordon B. Hinckley, First Counselor in the First Presidency,
        and President Thomas S. Monson, Second Counselor in the First Presidency. All twelve members of the Quorum of
        the Twelve spoke at various dedication sessions, and numerous other General Authorities also attended
        dedication activities.</p>
      <p>During the cornerstone ceremony, a group of children from Mexico were seated in front of the opening in the
        temple wall prepared for the cornerstone. They represented children from the five stakes and one district in
        Mexico that are part of the San Diego California Temple District. Children from those stakes had made a rug for
        the temple, and during the ceremony, General Authorities stood on that rug.
        <p>Energistically exploit effective solutions with fully researched data. Completely leverage existing
          standardized ROI through collaborative content. Compellingly supply fully researched ideas rather than
          real-time process improvements. Efficiently envisioneer proactive ideas after B2B materials. Proactively
          scale cross-media platforms vis-a-vis e-business manufactured products.</p>

        <p>Primary children from each stake in the United States within the temple district helped raise white
          geraniums, displayed near the temple entrance and around the cornerstone.
          The cornerstone, a sealed copper box containing significant items and historical documents concerning the
          temple, was put in place by President Hinckley and President Monson.</p>
