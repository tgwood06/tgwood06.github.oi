      <p class="sdinfo">The San Diego California Temple is the 47th constructed and 45th operating temple of The Church of Jesus
        Christ
        of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).[1] Located near the La Jolla community of San Diego, it was built with two
        main spires, but unique to this temple are four smaller spires at the base of each main spire. The East spire
        is
        topped with the familiar Angel Moroni statue which adorns most LDS temples.

        The San Diego Temple was announced on April 7, 1984, and dedicated on April 25, 1993 by Gordon B. Hinckley. The
        temple was built on a 7.2-acre (2.9 ha) plot, has 4 ordinance rooms and 8 sealing rooms, and has a total floor
        area of 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).

        Although there is no visitors' center, the church maintains the Mormon Battalion Historic Site in Old Town, San
        Diego. </p>

      <p>The San Antonio Texas Temple is the 120th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
          On June 24, 2001 the LDS Church announced it would build a temple in San Antonio, Texas, making it the state's fourth. Within ten years, the number of church members in the area grew from 9,000 to 12,000. Until the San Antonio Texas Temple was completed, Latter-day Saints in the area travelled 200 miles (320 km) to reach the nearest temple, near Houston.
          On March 29, 2003 a site dedication and groundbreaking ceremony initiated construction. As the temple neared completion in September 2004, a ceremony was held to place a thirteen-foot, gold leafed angel Moroni statue on the spire of the temple.
          After the building's completion, an open house was held April 16 through May 7, 2005 to allow people to see the inside of the temple. During these three weeks, more than 50,000 people took a tour through the newly finished temple. The inside of the temple is aesthetically furnished with African Cherrywood, stained glass windows, paintings of Jesus' life and a mural by San Antonio artist Keith Bond. The use of color in the stained glass windows, in a slightly muted southwest style, and the indigo and star motif inside the central spire sets this edifice apart from most all other LDS temples.
          LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the San Antonio Temple on May 22, 2005. A celebration was held at the Alamodome the night before the dedication. More than 20,000 people attended to watch a show featuring over 4,000 singers and dancers, horses, fireworks, and presentations of Texas history, family values, and Mormon beliefs. Hinckley spoke to those in attendance about the temple.
          The San Antonio Texas Temple serves about 45,250 members living in an area spanning from Hillsboro to Brownsville. It has a total of 16,800 square feet (1,560 m2), two ordinance rooms, two sealing rooms, and a baptistry. </p>

      <p>The Cedar City Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Cedar City, Utah, United States. The intent to construct the temple was announced by church president Thomas S. Monson on April 6, 2013, during the church's semi-annual general conference. The temple was announced concurrently with the Rio de Janeiro Brazil Temple; at the time, the announcement brought the total number of temples worldwide to 170. It is the 17th temple to be built in Utah.

        On Saturday, August 8, 2015, L. Whitney Clayton presided at a groundbreaking to signify the beginning of construction. A public open house was held from October 27 through November 18, 2017, excluding Sundays. The temple was dedicated on December 10, 2017 by Henry B. Eyring.
